Plant Information Page: Monstera Deliciosa (Swiss Cheese Plant)

Common Names:
Monstera,
Swiss Cheese Plant,
Split-leaf Philodendron (although not a true philodendron)

Scientific Name:
Monstera deliciosa

Origin:
Native to the tropical rainforests of Central America, particularly Mexico, Panama, and surrounding areas.

Why It Is an Indoor Plant:
Monstera deliciosa thrives in indoor environments because it prefers indirect sunlight and moderate temperatures.
It can adapt well to household lighting and humidity levels, making it perfect for home or office settings.

Watering Requirements:
Water when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry.
Typically, watering once every 7-10 days is sufficient, but this can vary based on indoor conditions.
Avoid overwatering as it may lead to root rot.

Temperature Range:
Ideal temperature: 65°F to 85°F (18°C to 29°C).
Should not be exposed to temperatures below 50°F (10°C).

Light Requirements:
Prefers bright, indirect light.
Can tolerate low light but may grow slower and develop fewer splits in leaves.
Avoid direct sunlight, which can burn the leaves.

Amazing Facts:
The holes or splits in the leaves are called fenestrations, which help the plant withstand strong winds and let light pass through to lower leaves in the wild.
Monstera deliciosa can grow very large, with leaves reaching up to 3 feet in width.
It produces a fruit in the wild that is said to taste like a mix of pineapple and banana.

Other Important Information:
Fertilize monthly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced houseplant fertilizer.
It enjoys humidity, so misting the plant occasionally or using a humidifier is beneficial.
Brown spots or yellowing leaves (as seen in the image) could be due to overwatering, underwatering, or low humidity.
Keep the plant away from cold drafts and direct heat sources.
Toxic to pets if ingested.

Care Tip:
Rotate the plant occasionally to promote even growth and prevent it from leaning towards the light source.
